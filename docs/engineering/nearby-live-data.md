# Nearby live data — collaborator handoff

**Status:** Implementation in progress on branch `feat/nearby-live-task1`.  
**Task 1 (models/config/deps):** **Complete** — covered by unit tests + Flutter CI.  
**Next:** Task 2 (Nominatim + Overpass) — first bulletproof live-data milestone.  
**Meeting context:** 2026-08-11 project call — Nearby / “locator” is the near-term engineering focus; static demo stays for pre-usability show-and-tell (`LIVE_NEARBY` still default off).

## Locked decisions (do not reopen without Karim)

1. **Demo default stays static.** `liveNearby` defaults **off**. Meeting demos use today’s New Brunswick fake list.
2. **Live path:** Google Places HTTP (optional) → **soft-fail** → **OSM Overpass** (supported path).
3. **No Google Cloud billing** for the study build. Empty / denied key is expected; OSM must work alone.
4. **No curated CWC overlay** in this spike (no bundled wellness/CWC merge JSON).
5. **Cross-platform:** one pure-Dart HTTP path for **iOS and Android** (no Apple MapKit-only search).
6. **Out of scope here:** map tiles UI, favorites, GPS permission flow, Learn/training changes.

## Spec tension (intentional spike)

Spec **FIND-1** (curated directory) and **TECH-6** (no commercial map API costs) remain authoritative for the funded MVP narrative. This workstream is a **live-locator spike** from the 2026-08-11 action item. Do **not** silently rewrite FIND-1. If live OSM becomes the product direction, bump the feature spec in a separate PR with research-team buy-in.

## Flags (planned; not in app yet)

```bash
# Default demo (meetings / pre-usability)
flutter run -d chrome

# Live mode once implemented (OSM expected; Google skipped without key)
flutter run -d chrome --dart-define=LIVE_NEARBY=true

# Optional Google attempt only if someone later enables a key + billing (not study default)
flutter run --dart-define=LIVE_NEARBY=true --dart-define=GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY=...
```

Never commit API keys. Never add billing setup scripts to this repo for the study build.

## Progress

| Task | Status |
|------|--------|
| 1 Models, config, deps | **Done** |
| 2 Nominatim + Overpass | Not started |
| 3 Google Places soft-fail | Not started |
| 4 Repository + cache | Not started |
| 5 NearbyScreen wiring | Not started |
| 6 Cross-platform verify + README flags | Not started |
| 7 Collaborator close-out | Not started |

## Split work (suggested)

| Person / agent | Start with |
|----------------|------------|
| A | ~~Models + config~~ → **Overpass/Nominatim + tests (Task 2)** |
| B | Google Places soft-fail client + repository orchestration |
| Then | UI flag wiring + disclaimer; keep demo path untouched |

## Meeting follow-ons (not this plan)

Unvetted disclaimer + “updated as of” ship with live UI. Favorites, voice-nav training materials, Learn sustainability, and first-run walkthrough are tracked as meeting feedback — separate plans.
